# MLB-Attendance

get_attendance_data.R uses the baseballR package to get each MLB game played from 2010 to 2019 from baseball reference.
The code then uses the data pulled in the first iteration to get more specific information regarding each game such as attendance,
also from baseball reference. The information is then saved in mlb_games.csv.
